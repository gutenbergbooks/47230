<h2><a name="SIR_WALTER_SCOTT_AND_HIS_DOGS" id="SIR_WALTER_SCOTT_AND_HIS_DOGS">SIR WALTER SCOTT AND HIS DOGS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of my pleasant recollections is that of seeing
Sir Walter Scott out on a stroll with his dogs;
the scene being in the neighbourhood of Abbotsford,
in the summer of 1824, while as yet the
gloom of misfortune had not clouded the mind
of the great man. There he was limping gaily
along with his pet companions amidst the rural
scenes which he had toiled to secure and loved so
dearly.</p>

<p>Scott's fondness for animals has perhaps never
been sufficiently acknowledged. It was with him
a kind of second nature, and appears to have been
implanted when as a child he was sent on a visit
to the house of his grandfather, Robert Scott, at
Sandyknowe, in the neighbourhood of Dryburgh.
Here, amidst flocks of sheep and lambs, talked to
and fondled by shepherds and ewe-milkers, and
revelling with collies, he was impressed with a
degree of affectionate feeling for animals which
lasted through life. At a subsequent visit to
Sandyknowe, when his grandfather had passed
away, and the farm operations were administered
by 'Uncle Thomas,' he was provided with a Shetland
pony to ride upon. The pony was little larger
than many a Newfoundland dog. It walked freely
into the house, and was regularly fed from the
boy's hand. He soon learned to ride the little
pony well, and often alarmed 'Aunt Jenny' by
cantering over the rough places in the neighbourhood.
Such were the beginnings of Scott's intercourse
with animals. Growing up, there was something
extraordinary in his attachment to his dogs,
his horses, his ponies, and his cats; all of which
were treated by him, each in its own sphere, as
agreeable companions, and which were attached
to him in return. There may have been something
feudal and poetic in this kindly association
with humble adherents, but there was also much
of simple good-heartedness. Scott added not a
little to the happiness of his existence by this
genial intercourse with his domestic pets. From
Lockhart's Memoirs of Sir Walter, and other
works, we have occasionally bright glimpses of
the great man's familiarity with his four-footed
favourites. We can see that Scott did not, as is
too often the case, treat them capriciously, as
creatures to be made of at one time, and spoken
to harshly when not in the vein for amusement.
On the contrary, they were elevated to the position
of friends. They possessed rights to be respected,
feelings which it would be scandalous to outrage.
At all times he had a soothing word, and a kind
pat, for every one of them. And that, surely, is
the proper way to behave towards the beings who
are dependent on us.</p>

<p>Among Sir Walter's favourite dogs we first hear
of Camp, a large bull-terrier, that was taken
with him when visiting the Ellises for a week at
Sunninghill in 1803. Mr and Mrs Ellis having
cordially sympathised in his fondness for this
animal, Scott, at parting, promised to send one of
Camp's progeny in the course of the season to
Sunninghill. As an officer in a troop of yeomanry
cavalry, Scott proved a good horseman, and we are
led to know that he was much attached to the
animal which he rode. In a letter to a friend
written at this period (1803), he says: 'I have,
too, a hereditary attachment to the animal&mdash;not, I
flatter myself, of the common jockey cast, but
because I regard him as the kindest and most
generous of the subordinate animals. I hardly
even except the dogs; at least, they are usually
so much better treated, that compassion for the
steed should be thrown into the scale when we
weigh their comparative merits.'</p>

<p>For several years Camp was the constant parlour
dog. He was handsome, intelligent, and fierce,
but gentle as a lamb among the children. At the
same time, there were two greyhounds, Douglas
and Percy, which were kept in the country for
coursing. Scott kept one window of his study
open, whatever might be the state of the weather,
that Douglas and Percy might leap out and in as
the fancy moved them. He always talked to Camp
as if he understood what was said&mdash;and the animal
certainly did understand not a little of it; in particular,
it seemed as if he perfectly comprehended
on all occasions that his master considered him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
sensible and steady friend; the greyhounds, as
volatile young creatures whose freaks must be
borne with.</p>

<p>William Laidlaw, the friend and amanuensis
of Scott, mentions in the <i>Abbotsford Notanda</i> a
remarkable instance of Camp's fidelity and attention.
It was on the occasion of a party visiting a
wild cataract in Dumfriesshire, known as the
Gray Mare's Tail. There was a rocky chasm to
be ascended, up which Scott made his way with
difficulty, on account of his lameness. 'Camp
attended anxiously on his master; and when the
latter came to a difficult part of the rock, Camp
would jump down, look up to his master's face,
then spring up, lick his master's hand and cheek,
jump down again, and look upwards, as if to
shew him the way and encourage him. We were
greatly interested with the scene.'</p>

<p>The most charming part of Scott's life was, as
we think, that which he spent with his family at
Ashestiel, from about 1804 to 1808, part of
which time he was engaged in writing <i>Marmion</i>.
Ashestiel was a country mansion situated on the
south bank of the Tweed, half way between
Innerleithen and Galashiels, and in what would
be called a solitary mountain district. There was
the river for fishing, and the hills for coursing,
and no other amusement. To enliven the scene,
literary friends came on short visits. There was
an odd character in the immediate neighbourhood,
called from his parsimony Old Nippie, whose
habits afforded some fun. When still at Ashestiel
in 1808, there is presented a pleasant picture by
Lockhart of the way in which Scott passed the
Sunday. The account of it is a perfect Idyll.
'On Sunday he never rode&mdash;at least not until his
growing infirmity made his pony almost necessary
for him&mdash;for it was his principle that all domestic
animals have a full right to their Sabbath of rest;
but after he had read the Church service, he
usually walked with his whole family, dogs included,
to some favourite spot at a considerable
distance from the house&mdash;most frequently the
ruined tower of Elibank&mdash;and there dined with
them in the open air on a basket of cold provisions,
mixing his wine with the water of the brook beside
which they were all grouped around him on the
turf; and here, or at home, if the weather kept
them from their ramble, his Sunday talk was just
such a series of biblical lessons as that preserved for
the permanent use of the rising generation in his
<i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>. He had his Bible, the Old
Testament especially, by heart; and on these days
inwove the simple pathos or sublime enthusiasm
of Scripture, in whatever story he was telling, with
the same picturesque richness as he did, in his
week-day tales, the quaint Scotch of Pitscottie, or
some rude romantic old rhyme from Barbour's
<i>Bruce</i> or Blind Harry's <i>Wallace</i>.'</p>

<p>Failing from old age, Camp was taken by the
family to Edinburgh, and there he died about
January 1809. He was buried in a fine moonlight
night in the little garden behind the house, No.
39 Castle Street, immediately opposite the window
where Scott usually sat writing. His daughter,
Mrs Lockhart, remembered 'the whole family standing
round the grave as her father himself smoothed
down the turf above Camp with the saddest expression
of face she had ever seen in him. He had
been engaged to dine abroad that day, but apologised
on account of "the death of a dear old friend."'
A few months later, Scott says in one of his
letters: 'I have supplied the vacancy occasioned
by the death of dear old Camp with a terrier
puppy of the old shaggy Celtic breed,' and which
he named Wallace. This new companion was
taken on an excursion to the Hebrides in 1810,
and in time partly compensated for the loss of
Camp. There came, however, a fresh bereavement
in 1812, in the death of the greyhound Percy.
Scott alludes to the fact in one of his letters.
'We are going on in the old way, only poor
Percy is dead. I intend to have an old stone set
up by his grave, with <i>Cy gist li preux Percie</i>
[Here lies the brave Percy]; and I hope future
antiquaries will debate which hero of the House of
Northumberland has left his bones in Teviotdale.'
The two favourite greyhounds are alluded to in the
Introduction to the second canto of <i>Marmion</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Remember'st thou my greyhounds true?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er holt or hill there never flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From slip or leash there never sprang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fleet of foot or sure of fang.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a letter dated Abbotsford, 1816, written to
Terry, with whom he communicated on literary
and dramatic subjects, he says: 'I have got from
my friend Glengarry the noblest dog ever seen on
the Border since Johnnie Armstrong's time. He
is between the wolf and deer hound, about six
feet long from the tip of the nose to the tail, and
high and strong in proportion: he is quite gentle
and a great favourite. Tell Will. Erskine he will
eat off his plate without being at the trouble to
put a paw on the table or chair. I shewed him
to Matthews, who dined one day in Castle Street
before I came here.'</p>

<p>The staghound so introduced was the famous
Maida, which came upon the scene when the
Waverley novels were beginning to set the world
on fire. Maida was the crack dog of Scott's life,
and figures at his feet in the well-known sculpture
by Steell. He did not quite supersede Wallace and
the other dogs, but assumed among them the most
distinguished place, and might be called the canine
major-domo of the establishment. On visiting
Abbotsford in 1817, Washington Irving enjoyed
the pleasure of a ramble with Scott and his dogs.
His description of the scene is so amusing that we
can scarcely abate a jot:</p>

<p>'As we sallied forth, every dog in the establishment
turned out to attend us. There was the old
staghound, Maida, that I have already mentioned,
a noble animal; and Hamlet, the black greyhound,
a wild thoughtless youngster, not yet arrived at
the years of discretion; and Finette, a beautiful
setter, with soft silken hair, long pendent ears, and
a mild eye, the parlour favourite. When in front
of the house, we were joined by a superannuated
greyhound, who came from the kitchen wagging
his tail; and was cheered by Scott as an old
friend and comrade. In our walks, he would
frequently pause in conversation, to notice his
dogs, and speak to them as if rational companions;
and, indeed, there appears to be a vast deal of
rationality in these faithful attendants on man,
derived from their close intimacy with him.
Maida deported himself with a gravity becoming
his age and size, and seemed to consider himself
called upon to preserve a great degree of dignity
and decorum in our society. As he jogged along
a little distance ahead of us, the young dogs would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
gambol about him, leap on his neck, worry at his
ears, and endeavour to tease him into a gambol.
The old dog would keep on for a long time with
imperturbable solemnity, now and then seeming to
rebuke the wantonness of his young companions.
At length he would make a sudden turn, seize one
of them, and tumble him in the dust, then giving
a glance at us, as much as to say: "You see, gentlemen,
I can't help giving way to this nonsense,"
would resume his gravity, and jog on as before.
Scott amused himself with these peculiarities. "I
make no doubt," said he, "when Maida is alone
with these young dogs, he throws gravity aside,
and plays the boy as much as any of them; but
he is ashamed to do so in our company, and seems
to say: Ha' done with your nonsense, youngsters:
what will the laird and that other gentleman think
of me if I give way to such foolery?"</p>

<p>'Scott amused himself with the peculiarities of
another of his dogs, a little shamefaced terrier,
with large glassy eyes, one of the most sensitive
little bodies to insult and indignity in the world.
"If ever he whipped him," he said, "the little
fellow would sneak off and hide himself from the
light of day in a lumber garret, from whence there
was no drawing him forth but by the sound of the
chopping-knife, as if chopping up his victuals,
when he would steal forth with humiliated and
downcast look, but would skulk away again if any
one regarded him."</p>

<p>'While we were discussing the humours and
peculiarities of our canine companions, some object
provoked their spleen, and produced a sharp and
petulant barking from the smaller fry; but it was
some time before Maida was sufficiently roused to
ramp forward two or three bounds, and join the
chorus with a deep-mouthed <i>bow wow</i>. It was but
a transient outbreak, and he returned instantly,
wagging his tail, and looking up dubiously in his
master's face, uncertain whether he would receive
censure or applause. "Ay, ay, old boy!" cried
Scott, "you have done wonders; you have shaken
the Eildon hills with your roaring; you may now
lay by your artillery for the rest of the day.
Maida," continued he, "is like the great gun at
Constantinople; it takes so long to get it ready,
that the smaller guns can fire off a dozen times
first."'</p>

<p>Maida accompanied his master to town, where he
occupied the place of the lamented Camp. In the
sanctum at Castle Street, Maida lay on the hearth-rug,
ready when called on to lay his head across
his master's knees, and to be caressed and fondled.
On the top step of a ladder for reaching down the
books from the higher shelves sat a sleek and
venerable Tom-cat, which Scott facetiously called
by the German name Hinse of Hinsfeldt. Lockhart
mentions that Hinse, 'no longer very locomotive,
usually lay watching the proceedings of
his master and Maida with an air of dignified
equanimity. When Maida chose to leave the
party, he signified his inclinations by beating the
door with his huge paw; Scott rose and opened
it for him with courteous alacrity&mdash;and then Hinse
came down purring from his perch, and mounted
guard by the foot-stool, <i>vice</i> Maida absent on
furlough. Whatever discourse might be passing
was broken, every now and then, by some affectionate
apostrophe to these four-footed friends.
Dogs and cats, like children, have some infallible
tact for discovering who is, and who is not, really
fond of their company; and I venture to say,
Scott was never five minutes in any room before
the little pets of the family, whether dumb or
lisping, had found out his kindness for all their
generation.'</p>

<p>In letters to his eldest son, Scott seldom fails
to tell him how things are going on with the
domesticated animals. For example: 'Hamlet had
an inflammatory attack, and I began to think he
was going mad, after the example of his great
namesake; but Willie Laidlaw bled him, and he
recovered. Pussy is very well.' Next letter:
'Dogs all well&mdash;cat sick&mdash;supposed with eating
birds in their feathers.' Shortly afterwards: 'All
here send love. Dogs and cat are well. I daresay
you have heard from some other correspondent
that poor Lady Wallace [a favourite pony] died
of an inflammation after two days' illness. Trout
[a favourite pointer] has returned here several
times, poor fellow, and seems to look for you;
but Henry Scott is very kind to him.' In a
succeeding letter we have the account of an accident
to Maida: 'On Sunday, Maida walked with
us, and in jumping the paling at the Greentongue
park, contrived to hang himself up by the hind-leg.
He howled at first, but seeing us making
towards him, he stopped crying, and waved his
tail, by way of signal, it was supposed, for assistance.
He sustained no material injury, though
his leg was strangely twisted into the bars, and he
was nearly hanging by it. He shewed great gratitude,
in his way, to his deliverers.'</p>

<p>At Abbotsford, in the autumn of 1820, when a
large party, including Sir Humphry Davy, Dr Wollaston,
and Henry Mackenzie were sallying out&mdash;Scott
on his pony Sybyl Grey, with Maida gambolling
about him&mdash;there was some commotion and
laughter when it was discovered that a little black
pig was frisking about and apparently resolved to
be one of the party for the day. Scott tried to
look stern, and cracked his whip at the creature,
but was in a moment obliged to join in the general
cheers. Poor piggy was sent home. 'This pig,'
says Lockhart, 'had taken, nobody could tell how,
a most sentimental attachment to Scott, and was
constantly urging his pretensions to be admitted a
regular member of his <i>tail</i> along with the greyhounds
and terriers; but indeed, I remember him
suffering another summer under the same sort of
pertinacity on the part of an affectionate hen. I
leave the explanation for philosophers&mdash;but such
were the facts.'</p>

<p>Mr Adolphus, a visitor to Abbotsford in 1830,
when the health of the great writer was breaking
down under his honourable and terribly imposed
task-work, gives us not the least striking instance
of Scott's wonderful considerateness towards animals.
'In the morning's drive we crossed several
fords, and after the rain they were wide and deep.
A little, long, wise-looking, rough terrier, named
Spice, which ran after us, had a cough, and as
often as we came to a water, Spice, by the special
order of his master, was let into the carriage till
we had crossed. His tenderness to his brute
dependants was a striking point in the benignity
of his character. He seemed to consult not only
their bodily welfare, but their feelings, in the
human sense. He was a gentleman even to his
dogs.' When too roughly frolicsome, he rebuked
them gently, so as not to mortify them, or spoil
the natural buoyancy of their character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span></p>

<p>We could extend these memorabilia, but have
perhaps said enough. Maida died in October
1824, and is commemorated in a sculptured figure
at the doorway of Abbotsford. His attached
master wrote an epitaph on him in Latin, which
he thus Englished:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beneath the sculptured form which late you wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep soundly, Maida, at your master's door.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a sad pang for Scott, when quitting home
to seek for health abroad, and which he did not
find, to leave the pet dogs which survived Maida.
His last orders were that they should be taken
care of. We may be permitted to join in the
noble eulogium pronounced on Scott by Willie
Laidlaw, who lived to mourn his loss, that Kindness
of heart was positively the reigning quality
of Sir Walter's character!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;OUR EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I watched</span> Lilian very anxiously for a few days
after our visit to Fairview. But although it had
given her a shock to find Arthur Trafford already
upon such familiar terms there, whilst there had
been no call at the cottage, nor even a message
sent to inquire after our well-being, she was not
permanently depressed in consequence. I must
do Arthur Trafford the justice to say that I think
he was ashamed of sending conventional messages
under the circumstances, and felt that bad as
silence was, it was in better taste than meaningless
words. Nevertheless, his sister might have
contrived a call, had she possessed the something
besides blue blood, which, in dear Mrs Tipper's
estimation, constitutes a gentlewoman, sufficiently
to recollect past kindness, and act up to her former
rôle of being Lilian's friend. Fortunately, Lilian
did not depend upon her friendship.</p>

<p>'Do not fear for me, Mary,' she whispered,
rightly interpreting my anxious looks.</p>

<p>I did not fear for her&mdash;in the long-run. I knew
that in time she would come to be even ashamed
of having given the name of love to her infatuation
for Arthur Trafford. But to attain that end, she
must not be allowed to dream over the past; and
I was casting about in my mind in the hope of
finding some plan for employing our time which
would be sufficiently interesting to absorb the
attention of her mind as well as her hands. Pupils
Mrs Tipper would not hear of; nor would she
allow us to render any assistance in the housekeeping,
insisting that Becky and she had no more
to do than they could very easily get through.
Indeed Becky worked with a will; Mrs Tipper
and she were the best of friends; and nothing
would have pleased them better than keeping
Lilian and me in the parlour in state, and waiting
upon us.</p>

<p>Fortunately we neither of us inclined for that
kind of state. Lilian knew as well as I did that
hers was not a nature to be nursed and petted out
of a trouble. As people thoroughly in earnest
generally do, we soon found a way of filling up our
time&mdash;a way which had a spice of novelty and
adventure in it, specially adapted to our present
frame of mind.</p>

<p>About a mile distant, on the high-road leading
from the left of the village towards the town of
Grayleigh, were a few cottages, which had been
erected for the accommodation of the labourers
upon some fruit and hop growing grounds in
the vicinity. Lilian and I had come upon them
in one of our walks; and their forlorn uncared-for
aspect appealed to our sympathies, and set
us thinking about the possibility of a remedy.
At length an idea suggested itself to us. During
the daytime, at this season of the year, they were
all unoccupied but one, where dwelt an old
woman past work, and who was, as she proudly
informed us, kept out of the workhouse by her
children. Through the medium of this old woman,
we applied for permission to do what we could
for the absent wives and mothers, in the way
of making the desolate-looking hovels more like
homes. There seemed some difficulty in obtaining
leave. We afterwards found that there had been
grave deliberations as to the expediency of allowing
us the freedom of the place, there being all
sorts of doubts and speculations as to our motives.
But after two or three visits to old Sally Dent,
during which she sharply questioned and cross-questioned
us, she gave us to understand that it
was agreed that we might try what we could do;
though I believe permission was given more out
of curiosity to see what our intention was, than
from anything else; and she was cautious enough
to inform us that they reserved to themselves the
right of putting a summary stop to our visits
whenever it should please them so to do. For the
present, Sally Dent gave us the key of the end
cottage, which was to be duly returned when
what she ungraciously termed our 'rummaging'
was over.</p>

<p>'Not as you will find much to rummage at Meg
Lane's,' chuckled the old woman. 'She ain't taken
any pride in her home since she had to sell her
bits of things when they were down with the
fever.'</p>

<p>It did appear rather unwarrantable to unlock
the door and enter the place in the absence of the
inmates, before we had even made their acquaintance;
but we satisfied ourselves with the hope that
the end would be found to justify the means; and
the very first day we contrived to leave a pleasant
indication of our intentions.</p>

<p>The cottage contained two rooms up-stairs, and
one on the ground floor opening to the road, with
a little back scullery. We did not intrude into
the upper regions, contenting ourselves with
putting things into some sort of order in the little
sitting-room. Perhaps I had better not describe
how very real our work was, and how hopeless at
first seemed the task we had undertaken. But we
worked with a will, enjoying many a little jest at
the idea of what Mrs Tipper's astonishment would
be if she could see us with our sleeves tucked up
sweeping out dirty corners, when we were supposed
to be taking our daily constitutional as decorous
gentlewomen should. Lilian devoted herself
to one dirty cupboard with a pertinacity which,
I gravely informed her, did equal honour to her
head and heart, considering the time it would take
to make any visible improvement. Four shelves
filled with a heterogeneous collection of unwashed
cups and saucers, bread new and stale, scraps of
meat (some not too fresh), a jug coated with a thick
fur of sour milk, dirty plates, mugs smelling of
stale beer, bits of old pipes, and so forth&mdash;'all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
canopied o'er' with spiders' webs, certainly were
an undertaking.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that we intended
solely to employ ourselves in sweeping and cleaning:
no indeed; the little we did in that way
was only intended to serve as a suggestion for
others to carry out. Our ambition was to induce
the people to begin to feel that they had homes,
and so in time to take some little pride in keeping
them neat themselves.</p>

<p>The small amount of money which we allowed
ourselves to spend was spent in a way which
might not a little surprise some people. We tried
to make the little room attractive, with an ornament
or two, which though inexpensive, were in good
taste and pretty in shape and colouring&mdash;a primitive
hanging shelf with two or three neatly bound
books, a clean blind, a nicely framed print for the
wall, and so forth, all new and fresh and bright;
a contrast with the blackened ceiling, which we
hoped would in time suggest whitewash. Then
we boldly challenged our hosts, as we laughingly
termed them, with a clean hearth; and after persisting
two or three days, we were delighted to
find that the hint was taken&mdash;that our clean hearth-stone
had brought about a decently brushed grate.</p>

<p>By this time we were presented with the key
of the next cottage, together with a pressing
invitation to extend the field of our operations.
As days went on we began to feel a little proud
of our success, such as it was, though it could not
be said to have been achieved without difficulty.
In the outset, all sorts of obstacles were placed
in our way. It took us, for instance, some days
to bring a certain dirty table to reason. After
cleaning away sundry marks, such as beer-stains,
which offended our sense of propriety, we invariably
found it as dirty as ever. A more unmanageable
piece of business than this obstinate old table
is not often found. It really was depressing, as
Lilian said, to find our efforts so entirely ignored,
not to say set at naught; though of course we did
not intend to yield. We tried the effect of placing
a little round waiter on the table, in the hope
that its use would suggest itself; but without
any good result. At length I began to perceive
that this was a case in which we were contending
against one of the lords of creation, and that for
some reason he considered it necessary to assert
his independence.</p>

<p>'It's old Jemmy Rodgers as lives with his
darter,' explained Sally Dent, to whom I had put
a question upon the point. 'He says you ain't
a-doing all this for nothing&mdash;'t ain't likely; and
he ain't a-going to give in to the new ways till
he knows for certain what's to come of it.'</p>

<p>'I should think he might be sure no harm could
come of it.'</p>

<p>'He ain't so sure, Miss. <i>He</i> says' (carefully
fixing the responsibility upon Jemmy Rodgers)
'that perhaps you only wants to make us all
obligated to you, so as we can't shake you off when
you comes by-and-by a-worriting about'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'About what?' I asked, seeing that she hesitated
to go on.</p>

<p>'Well, there; he says, most like you have
got hold of some newfangled way for saving souls,
and you wants to try it on we. William Marther,
he says there's all sorts of new ways a-being tried
up in London. But we are old-fashioned folks,
and we've got enough to do to read our Bibles
and 'tend to what the clergyman says. He's a
good kind gentleman; and if he worrits a bit
about the drink and all that, we don't mind it
from he, because he shews us the texts for what
he says, and there's no saying nay to <i>them</i>.'</p>

<p>I very gravely assured her that I had no intention
whatever of worriting; and that we did not,
at anyrate for the present, even desire to make
the acquaintance of the cottagers.</p>

<p>'But you must have <i>some</i> reason for doing it,
Miss; at least Jemmy Rodgers ses so,' said Sally
Dent, eyeing us sharply.</p>

<p>'Tell Jemmy Rodgers that if he attended more
to what Mr Wyatt teaches, he would not be so
ready to doubt others,' I replied.</p>

<p>And leaving that to sink into Jemmy Rodgers'
heart, we cleaned away at the table again. All
to no purpose; that table represented Jemmy
Rodgers' independence of us and our help, and
we regularly found it in the same state every
morning. But we made up our minds that even
Jemmy Rodgers must have a weakness somewhere;
and after a few diplomatic questions to
Sally Dent, we discovered it. Once his weakness
discovered, Jemmy Rodgers was vanquished, though
it cost us five shillings to do it, and he really did
not deserve to have that much spent upon him.
But by-and-by perhaps, he would understand that
it was the victory only which had been paid for.
A neat little bracket was placed beside the fireplace,
and on it, Jemmy Rodgers one evening
found a pretty stone tobacco-jar filled with good
tobacco, and a nice new pipe. Not a little curiously
did we open the door the next morning. There
was only one mark on the table, and that a
very faint one, as a sort of feeble protest that
Jemmy Rodgers was not to be bought; but after
that we were left to our own devices; regarded,
I think, as eccentric, but eccentric in a way that
no one had any right to object to&mdash;something
like children who had a fancy for playing at being
servants.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, we were beginning to be
rewarded in the way we most cared for. There
were unmistakable signs of a disposition to keep
the little homes in a more orderly state; and the
delight our modest offerings in the way of ornament
gave, was very marked as well as suggestive.</p>

<p>The love which the poor display for some little
possession in the way of ornament, is not always,
I think, sufficiently considered. I can only say
that I have known one little thing of beauty, or
even a faint and blurred image of beauty, to have
a more refining influence in a cottage home than
many would suspect. Wherever a cherished bit
of china or what not is found, there will be also
found some tendency towards making the surroundings
more worthy of it.</p>

<p>I found that our proceedings not a little puzzled
Mr Wyatt; an earnest, anxious, good man, well
known as a friend to the poor in all directions.
He too for a time was under the impression that
we might possibly be paving the way to introduce
doctrinal matters, and felt it, I think, to be his
duty to ascertain what these were. It was, I
knew, not by chance he one morning made his
appearance at the door of a cottage we happened
to be at work in. I was busily engaged hammering
in a nail for a picture, and did not turn my
head when the sunlight streamed in through
the open doorway, imagining that Lilian had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
re-entered, she having gone to borrow a broom
from the next house.</p>

<p>'A more wrong-headed nail than this never
existed! We must not forget nails the next time
we go to Grayleigh, Lilian.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon.'</p>

<p>I turned hastily round and met the eyes of Mr
Wyatt. Descending from the chair, as gracefully
as might be, with due regard to its ricketiness, I
offered my hand.</p>

<p>'How do you do, Mr Wyatt? We are not quite
strangers, I think?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed,' he replied, looking not a little
relieved. Though in the interests of his poor, he
had made up his mind to find out who and what
we were, he was too much a gentleman to enjoy
doing it. I knew afterwards that he had feared
having to do battle with some lady with objectionable
views and an objectionable way of advocating
them; and it was therefore natural enough he
should be a great deal relieved to see one of the
members of his small congregation. As I have
said elsewhere, Lilian and I had, in the prosperous
days, preferred attending the primitive little
church on the road to Grayleigh, to going to the
newly built and more highly decorated church on
the hill. And as the congregation consisted mostly
of labouring people and the small shopkeepers in
the village, it was natural that the appearance of
two strangers should attract some attention, which
had led to his introducing himself, and a pleasant
acquaintance springing up between us.</p>

<p>It was this little church which the inmates of the
'Home,' as it was gracefully designated, attended;
sitting in the organ-loft, where they were out of
range of curious eyes; a consideration for which
I afterwards found they were indebted to Mr
Wyatt. We had frequently passed them on their
road to church; and I had been painfully struck by
the hopeless, not to say sullen and discontented
aspect of most of the women, as they filed slowly
along, the matron's rich silks and velvets in too
marked a contrast to the ugliness of her charge's
attire, which I thought savoured unnecessarily of
prison uniform for those who were supposed to
be struggling to free themselves from past associations.</p>

<p>Then I was disappointed that my occasional
smile and word, as we stood aside for them to
pass into the porch, should be considered an
offence by the matron, as it so evidently was.
And I could not see why I should not offer a
few violets I was carrying, which the eyes of one
of the women seemed to ask for as we passed them
one morning in the road.</p>

<p>'I am to give 'em back, Miss,' she exclaimed,
running after me and putting them into my hand.
'It's against rules, please&mdash;that is, the mistress
says I mustn't have them.'</p>

<p>'Well, I cannot present you with the beautiful
sky, and that lark's song, and the glorious sunshine,
for they are yours already; but please take
my good-wishes and give me yours.'</p>

<p>She stood gazing at me a moment, then turned
away without a word, and ran back.</p>

<p>'This,' continued Mr Wyatt, '<i>is</i> a surprise, Miss
Haddon. I did not at all expect to find you to
be one of the mysterious ladies I have of late
heard so much about from the cottagers here. Is
Miss'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes; Miss Maitland is the other delinquent,'
I smilingly replied, as he hesitated over the name,
and so shewed me that he knew something of
what had occurred. At this moment Lilian came
in, her skirts and sleeves tucked up, a handkerchief
tied corner-wise over her hair, and a broom
in her hand.</p>

<p>'We really must contrive to squeeze a better
broom than this out of next week's allowance,
Mary; it won't go into the corners a bit.' (We
had agreed to restrict ourselves to spending only
so much a week upon our protégées, leaving the
rest to our own ingenuity.) 'We cannot make
brooms, you know; and oh'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr Wyatt, Lilian.'</p>

<p>He gave her a low bow in return for hers, and
I fancied that I understood why he was a trifle
more embarrassed with her than with me. Lilian
had never looked more lovely than she did thus,
her refined order of beauty idealising her working
dress. The clear, deep-blue eyes, hair of <i>unpurchasable</i>
gold, the soft rosy cheeks, and white
delicately rounded arms bared, to the elbow, what
a charming picture it was! I do not think I
would even have dispensed with the little stray
black, which had perched itself at the edge of a
dimple, much more effectively than anything in
the way of a patch could do it. One might
have imagined her the beautiful Princess who
went as serving-maid in the Ogre's castle, protected
only by her goodness and innocence&mdash;all-sufficient
protectors in fairy tales, and more than
they are always allowed to be in real life&mdash;to
obtain the release of her captive father. She was
so natural too, and devoid of all attempts to attract;
and only sensitive as a pure good girl, with a
delicate sense of truth and honour, is sensitive.</p>

<p>'You have heard what we are attempting here,
Mr Wyatt?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Yes;' slowly and awkwardly. 'But I am not
altogether sure that I understand your plan.'</p>

<p>I gave him a little explanation of what our
intentions were; and he listened gravely and
politely, though I could see that I did not entirely
succeed in proselytising him. He was ready
enough to give us credit for good intentions; but
when we were bold enough to ask his opinion as
to our succeeding, he acknowledged that he had
not much hope of our being able to do permanent
good. And when Lilian a little triumphantly told
him about our success with Jemmy Rodgers, he
smilingly pointed out that that was a success which
had been purchased. In truth he confessed that
he belonged to the old school, and did not take
kindly to innovations.</p>

<p>'I do not, for example, like seeing a lady doing
such work as Miss Maitland is doing for people
who have quite enough time to keep their own
homes clean and neat, if they would only do so,
instead of going down to spend their spare hours
at the village ale-house.'</p>

<p>'But we are hoping to get them to do that, Mr
Wyatt,' said Lilian. 'We are trying to make the
homes more attractive than the ale-houses.'</p>

<p>'I can only hope you will succeed, Miss Mervyn.'</p>

<p>'Well, I call it a tiny bit of success to get Meg
Lane, as they call her, to brighten her fire-grate
and clean her window.'</p>

<p>'Purchased,' he replied, smilingly.</p>

<p>But I could see that he advanced his objections
hesitatingly and doubtfully; and I felt that he
would be ready enough to acknowledge that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
were right, whenever we could prove that we were;
and we did not despair of that in time. Moreover,
he had now no fear of our attempting to disturb
the faith of his flock.</p>

<p>We came off a great deal better with Mr Wyatt
than with the district visitors at the cottages;
though even they recognised the wisdom of non-interference,
and kept aloof, paying their weekly
visits in the afternoons when we had retired.
Nevertheless, we quite understood why we were
always finding certain tracts of a very decided
tendency placed in our way, had old Sally Dent
not informed us that we were regarded as not
being quite 'safe.' We just worked on, and did
not intrude ourselves upon the residents at the
cottages; not even knowing them by sight, and
making a <i>détour</i> on our way to church on Sundays,
for the purpose of avoiding them.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;MORE WEAK THAN WICKED.</h3>

<p>Robert Wentworth took good care that our time
should not hang heavily upon our hands when we
were at home, urging us to work, and keeping us
well supplied with books, such as he had gradually
got me into the habit of reading&mdash;books which
required some little mental exercise for their
proper appreciation. Moreover, he demanded notes,
a paraphrase, or criticism, upon all we read; being
very exacting about our getting thoroughly to the
root of the subject treated upon, and having no
mercy upon what he termed a slovenly habit of
thinking.</p>

<p>We were much amused at the tests he gave us,
and the impossibility of throwing dust in his eyes.
If Lilian wrote my thoughts upon a subject, and I
hers, he detected which belonged to which with an
unerring readiness which proved that our minds
were as open books to him. The very difference
in his treatment of us when he found us flagging,
bantering&mdash;not to say taunting&mdash;me, and encouraging
Lilian, I now think was a proof that he knew
the kind of spur we each needed. And although I
believed that he was doing all this for Lilian's sake,
I was none the less grateful for the benefit it was
to me. At his suggestion, Lilian was doing a little
French with me, for which she gave me German;
whilst our sketch-books were not allowed to lie
entirely unused. All this, with what dear Mrs
Tipper called our long walks&mdash;she did not as yet
know how our mornings were employed&mdash;sent us
healthily tired each night to bed.</p>

<p>Robert Wentworth came down twice and sometimes
three times during the week; and after we
had given him a <i>résumé</i> of the work we had done
in the interval, we finished the evenings with
music and singing. Lilian's voice was not her
least charm. Then would come some triumph of
dear Mrs Tipper's skill in the way of little appetising
dainties for our substantial tea, and afterwards
Lilian and I went along the lanes with him
as far as the stile, which separated them from the
fields, in the summer moonlight, bidding him goodnight
there.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant life, though at the time I
naturally could not think it <i>the</i> pleasantest; it was
merely the pleasant peaceful prelude&mdash;the, so to
speak, preparation for the fuller life to come. But
best of all, Lilian was beginning to enter into it
with real enjoyment, less as a life lived from duty
than from love.</p>

<p>'It is what I never hoped for&mdash;to see my darling
get over it so well as this!' confided dear Mrs
Tipper to me.</p>

<p>'They cannot at anyrate call her broken-hearted
at present,' was my cheerful rejoinder.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, dear. I shall begin now to hope
that by-and-by some one more worthy of her may
have a chance; and I shall yet live to see my
Lilian's children about me.&mdash;And you too will be
thinking of getting married presently, dear?' with
what I fancied was an inquiring glance.</p>

<p>I murmured something to the effect that perhaps
my time would come; even then shrinking a
little nervously from entering into details.</p>

<p>'Of course it will, dear; and Lilian's too.
Already there is Mr Wyatt making all sorts of
excuses for finding his way to the cottage. A nice
gentleman; isn't he, dear&mdash;shews what brings him
so plain too; doesn't he?'</p>

<p>Yes, he did shew it plainly; no doubt of that.
If he did not already love Lilian, he was on the
very verge of it. But that was not at all in accordance
with my hopes.</p>

<p>'You forget Mr Wentworth,' I put in smilingly.
She looked up into my face for a moment; then
bent over her knitting again, as I went on: 'I
think you must have guessed what brings <i>him</i> so
often down here now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mary; yes, I have, dear.'</p>

<p>'And so have I; but I suppose it's early days
for talking of it yet.'</p>

<p>'Very well, dear; you know best about that,
of course. I will only say that Robert Wentworth
is a great favourite of mine.'</p>

<p>'That is because he is so good, auntie,' said
Lilian, who had caught the last words as she
entered the room. 'He is the very best and kindest
friend we have known.'</p>

<p>'The <i>very</i> best, dearie?' I asked.</p>

<p>She flushed to her temples; then, after a moment,
repeated in a low clear tone: 'The very
best and kindest, Mary.'</p>

<p>I was quite satisfied. No love-lorn damsel
could talk in that way. Arthur Trafford no longer
disturbed her peace. Everything was going on
favourably for Robert Wentworth; and the sooner
poor Mr Wyatt was allowed to perceive the real
state of the case, the better for his future peace.</p>

<p>Two months had glided thus pleasantly away.
There was now only one shadow upon Lilian's
mind, though that was an abiding one. The wrong
done to the innocent mother was not likely to be
forgotten by her child. It was that, and <i>not</i> the
loss of her lover, which caused the soft yearning
regretful expression that still lingered in the
beautiful blue eyes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we had accustomed ourselves to
think of Arthur Trafford as Miss Farrar's lover,
before the news reached us that it was so; and I
was very proud of Lilian's calm reception of it.
After that, it was easy to get over the additional
information that the marriage was arranged to
take place very shortly.</p>

<p>Marian adopted the tone&mdash;I think I knew by
whom it was suggested&mdash;of Arthur Trafford having
been badly treated by Lilian, who had cruelly
cast him off; and that made matters easier for us
all. As Marian said, Lilian could not blame her
for accepting one whom she herself had rejected.
Nor had she had any misgivings about his love.
Fortunately for her own peace, she did not suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
that Arthur Trafford's love for her was less than
hers for him. And the readiness with which he
had transferred his affections was interpreted in
the same convenient way. 'The truth is, he had
not seen <i>me</i> when he engaged himself to Lilian,'
she confided to me in a little aside. '<i>You</i>
knew he admired me from the very first; <i>now</i>,
didn't you, Miss Haddon? I don't blame you now
for being cross about his paying me such compliments
when he was engaged to Lilian; he really
couldn't help it, poor fellow! And I do believe
that if Lilian had played her cards well, he would
have acted honourably to her; he says he should.
But you can't blame me for being glad things have
turned out as they have, neither. Caroline says
only <i>envious</i> people would blame me.'</p>

<p>I really did not much blame her. I suppose she
acted up to her perception in the matter; and I
know she meant now to be good-natured. I will
do her the justice to say she was honestly glad to
find that Lilian shewed no sign of distress at the
engagement.</p>

<p>'If you had been miserable or disagreeable about
it, I don't know what I should have done, dear,'
she said with engaging confidence. 'It would be
like that story in the what's-its-name, you know,
two sisters in love with the same man. Though I
don't think&mdash;I'm <i>sure</i> I shouldn't have poisoned
you. I expect I should have joined your hands,
and then died of a broken heart;' sentimentally.</p>

<p>At which Lilian broke into a smile, and Marian
was satisfied. In truth, no one could now have
imagined Lilian a love-sick damsel, so improved
was she in health and spirits by our present life.</p>

<p>Marian was very pressing with us to be present
at the wedding, which was to be a very grand one,
she told us.</p>

<p>'But I tell Caroline, I shan't care for it a bit if
Lilian won't be first bridesmaid. And it shouldn't
cost you a penny, dear,' she urged. 'Everything
of the very best, and made at Madame Michaud,
if you will only say you will come?'</p>

<p>But Lilian was firm; and then Marian tried the
effect of her persuasive powers upon Mrs Tipper.</p>

<p>'You really must, aunt. It would look worse
for you to stop away than even for Lilian&mdash;my
own aunt!'</p>

<p>But Mrs Tipper also shewed that it was not to
be thought of; and Marian at length came to the
conclusion that their refusal arose from their sense
of the wrong done to Lilian's mother; though she
was quite as much at a loss to account for that as
for everything else we did.</p>

<p>'I don't see why you should be so put out
about a thing which can't be helped. When it
was thought that it was <i>my</i> Ma who had been
taken in, I behaved sensibly about it; and why
can't Lilian and you do the same?'</p>

<p>Great preparation were being made for the
event; and a great deal of company&mdash;'Caroline's'
friends&mdash;was constantly at Fairview. Rumours
reached us that the bridegroom expectant was
not in very good health; indeed it was said that
the marriage was being hastened on that account,
a change of climate having been recommended for
a while.</p>

<p>I saw him once only before his marriage, and
that happened by chance. Had Lilian really
suffered from his desertion of her&mdash;had I felt
any desire to see her avenged&mdash;I must have been
satisfied. As it was I felt almost inclined to
pity him, as more weak than wicked. I do not
believe that any utterly bad man would be as
heartily ashamed of himself as Arthur Trafford
appeared to be when he saw Lilian for the first
time after his approaching marriage with 'Miss
Farrar' was announced.</p>

<p>The Fairview party were attending morning
service at the little church to which Lilian and
I went. I do not think that they had the
slightest expectation of seeing us there; since
they could not know that we should choose the
long walk to that out-of-the-way little church, in
preference to attending the one in the village.
Most probably they went there for the drive, or
perhaps to create a little sensation, which Miss
Farrar was candid enough to acknowledge she had
a <i>penchant</i> for doing.</p>

<p>They were shewn into the best pew, as befitted
people who had arrived in state, the old clerk
himself seeing that their wants in the way of
hassocks and hymn-books were duly supplied,
before signing to his subordinate to cease pulling
<i>the</i> bell, and stepping back into the vestry for Mr
Wyatt, whom he always carefully buttoned into
his reading-desk before shutting himself up in his
own square box beneath. How thankful I felt
that although Arthur Trafford could see Lilian,
she was so placed that she could not see him.
I was glad too that he should see her thus&mdash;shewing
no traces of suffering from his desertion,
her face blooming with the delicate rose-tint of
health, and its whole expression calm, and sweet,
and pure; whilst she joined in the service in a way
which betokened no wandering thoughts, unconscious
of the eyes bent upon her half in shame,
half in regret. He was surprised, I fancied even
disagreeably so, to find his loss borne so calmly as
this. And though he no doubt persuaded himself
that he was glad to see that his desertion had not
permanently injured her, his vanity was wounded.</p>

<p>It was just as well that the bride-elect had
no misgivings about herself, and was too much
occupied in admiring some bracelets, which I
suppose she was wearing for the first time, to
notice the direction of her lover's eyes. She did
not perceive us where we sat, and I contrived to
whisper a few words so as to draw Lilian's attention
from them, as they passed down the aisle on
their way out. They had driven away before she
knew that they had been there, and I was rejoiced
to find that her walk home was none the less
enjoyed for my telling her of it.</p>

<p>The following evening Lilian was seated at the
piano trying a new song which Robert Wentworth
had brought down with him. He was standing
by her side, listening attentively and critically,
stopping her every now and then, to make her go
over the ground again, frankly pointing out defects
of style or what not, as his habit was with all we
did. A glorious July evening.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world's comforter, with weary gait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His day's hot task has ended in the west.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was sitting at the open window, my eyes turned
towards the hill-side, bathed in the glory of departing
day, my mind attuned to Lilian's music, and
reflecting the <i>couleur de rose</i> of the scene outside.
I was indulging myself with a peep into dream-land,
though a little doubtfully, and somewhat as
an interloper, liable at any time to be warned off
the enchanted ground, which, in my self-consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
I told myself youth alone has a right to enter,
when my attention was attracted towards Becky,
standing at the door and beckoning me out of the
room.</p>

<p>'A letter for you, Miss; just come by the
evening post,' she whispered, slipping it into my
hand when I joined her outside. I noticed that
Becky always called me aside to give me the
foreign letters now; as though she intuitively felt
that I should prefer to receive them when alone.</p>

<p>I thanked her with a look; and hastily catching
up my garden-hat, slipped by the window and out
at the gate, unobserved; then hurried down the
lane to read my precious letter at the stile, in the
red glory of the sunset.</p>

<p>A letter from Philip&mdash;and what a letter!&mdash;'My
wife&mdash;my dear wife. At last I am setting my
face homewards'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, well; I think I will tell the rest in my own
words. I have been chary of quoting Philip's
letters hitherto, and they shall be sacred still.
Enough for me to say that his affairs were definitely
settled at last. He loved me&mdash;he <i>did</i> love
me&mdash;in a way which it made me humble to think
of; humble, and proud, and glad, with all a
woman's strength and depth. Ah! Philip, for
once I was satisfied for your sake; it <i>was</i> something
stronger, and deeper, and more enduring
than a girl's love awaiting you!</p>

<p>How tenderly he wrote about the pain which
the long waiting had cost him! How tenderly he
dwelt upon what he termed my unselfishness in
acceding to the delay! How rejoiced he seemed
to be at last able to claim me&mdash;'<i>me</i>,' I repeated,
nodding pleasantly at a wild rose peeping round
the hedge. 'You wouldn't imagine it, I daresay,
but it is true, nevertheless.'</p>

<p>Philip had never written like this before; never
until now had it been so evident how much the
long waiting had cost him. Whilst I had sometimes
tormented myself with fears lest the separation
should at length have become a matter of
course to him, he had been silently rebelling. I
could only judge how much by the sudden revulsion&mdash;the
contrast in his tone now that the waiting
was at an end.</p>

<p>He had made enough to satisfy us two, without
any more 'money-grubbing,' as he termed it. He
would have nearly two thousand a year when he
had retired from the partnership and all was
settled. We could now live the life we had
dreamt of in the old times, with the gratification
of knowing that we had earned it. Any time
after the middle of next month he might be
expected. 'And you must amuse yourself in the
meantime in deciding where we are to pitch our
tent. Look about for a house after your own heart
for us to settle down in;' and so forth, and so forth.
Was ever woman so blessed! My whole being
steeped in happiness, I clasped my hands upon
the top bar of the stile and tried to offer up a
thanksgiving. What had I done to deserve all
the happiness showered upon me? What was I
that I should be so blessed? But mental prayer
was not enough. There was the irresistible desire
to <i>give</i> as well as receive, which is experienced
in all seasons of great joy. Who can love one
truly without being in more sympathy with all
humanity! I only know that I felt I could not
bear my happiness aright until I had, so to speak,
consecrated it by some act of love.</p>

<p>I slipped my letter into the bosom of my dress,
turned down the lane which ran at right angles
with that leading from the cottage, and walked
swiftly on. On I went, without thinking whither;
yielding to the impulse upon me, without pausing
to ask myself how far I should have to go, or
what I should find to do in those silent lanes.
Was some subtle influence at work with me, of
which at the time I was not conscious? Was
some guardian spirit leading me towards an end it
was not necessary for me to see? I only know
that I shall never believe it was only chance which
led me to a certain spot that night!</p></div>

<h2><a name="SUBMARINE_CABLES" id="SUBMARINE_CABLES">SUBMARINE CABLES.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>THEIR MANUFACTURE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-seven</span> years ago the first submarine cable
was laid across the Strait of Dover. This was a
single copper wire covered in gutta-percha, which
parted next day; and the first practicable submarine
cable was laid in 1851, on the same route.
Since then the progress of ocean telegraphy has
been extraordinary; no fewer than six cables
spanning the Atlantic bed&mdash;five to North America
(although these are not all working), and one to
South America by way of Madeira and Pernambuco.
And so extensive is the already existing
network of foreign cables, that when Asia is united
to America by cabling the Pacific, the electric girdle
round the world will be complete from east to
west, as it now is between north and south.</p>

<p>In this great development of telegraphy our
countrymen have unquestionably furnished both
the lion's share of the work and the capital. The
cables have nearly all been manufactured in London,
which is the headquarters of telegraphy.</p>

<p>The principal parts of a submarine cable are:
the <i>conductor</i>; the <i>insulator</i>; and the <i>protector</i> or
sheathing. The conductor, as its name implies, is
the wire which conducts or conveys the electric current
from one place to another. It corresponds to the
iron wire of our ordinary open air or land lines of
telegraph. Along this wire, as is well known, the
current from the battery at the station from which
the message is being sent travels to the station
receiving the message, where it passes to the earth,
and appears to return through the earth to the
battery again; thus <i>completing its circuit</i>. There
are two distinct parts of the circuit which the
current has to traverse&mdash;namely, the outgoing part,
represented by the wire or <i>conductor</i>; and the
return part, represented by the earth itself; and
inasmuch as these two parts must be kept distinct
and apart throughout their length, the wire which
is laid along the earth's surface must be kept apart
from the earth, to secure which the conductor is
entirely surrounded with an <i>insulator</i>. In land
lines, erected on posts overhead, the wire is separated
or insulated from the earth by the air, which
is, when dry, the most perfect insulator known;
and at the points of support, contact with the
earth is prevented by the use of porcelain, stoneware,
or vulcanite 'insulators,' to which the
conducting wire is fastened.</p>

<p>An insulator is a non-conducting substance, impervious,
so to speak, to electricity. It is the
theoretical antipodes of a conductor. While the
conductor is a substance through or over which
electricity flows freely, the insulator will neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
permit electricity to pass through its mass nor over
its surface. It can therefore be used as a means
of confining electricity to a conductor, and preventing
it from escaping to other conductors in
the neighbourhood. In short it can be made to
insulate or isolate the particular conductor from
all other conductors. Its use in a submarine
cable is to confine the electric current to the
conductor or wire, so that it travels along it
from one station to the other without escaping
to the water, and through that to the earth
(which, as we have already said, is the neighbouring
conductor, and the return part of the
circuit) on its way. It is therefore of course
important that there shall be no flaw in the
insulator, and in order to protect it from strain
and violence, it is covered with a strong guard or
sheathing. This outer sheathing or protector, which
is composed of twisted metal strands, is purely
mechanical. Only the conductor and the insulator
are concerned in the <i>electrical</i> requirements of the
cable.</p>

<p>The conductor is invariably of copper wire,
that metal being chosen because, next to silver,
which is of course too expensive, it is the best
metallic conductor of electricity. The metals, as
distinguished from most other minerals, are
excellent conductors of electricity; that is to
say, they oppose relatively <i>less resistance</i> to the
passage of the electric current through their
mass. There is an economy of power in using
a good conductor for the telegraphic line. The
current is less weakened when the resistance to
its passage along the line of wire is less, and
it is therefore capable of more powerful effects
throughout the route, and consequently at the
other end. The conductivity or conducting
power of a wire increases with the thickness
of the wire; and therefore by taking a thicker
wire of a more common metal than copper
(such as iron), the resistance to the passage of the
current may be made as small as when a thin
copper wire is employed. But it is important that
the conductor of a submarine cable, especially of
a long one, should be of as fine dimensions as
possible, in order to economise insulating material
and sheathing, and reduce the total weight of the
finished line. Therefore the advantages in point
of price of iron wire over copper in the first place,
would be greatly overbalanced by the increased
cost of insulating and sheathing it. It is of the
greatest importance that the copper wire of the
cable should be as pure as possible, for the slightest
trace of arsenic or other foreign element is sufficient
to hamper, in some mysterious way, the swift
course of the subtle current, and very materially
to weaken the conducting power of the wire.</p>

<p>In a few cables the copper conductor has been
made in the form of a single thick wire; but for the
sake of greater flexibility and less risk of breakage,
it is generally made in the form of a strand of
three or more, and frequently of seven wires; six
set round a central one. The wires are wound
together in a spiral strand, and their interstices
filled with an adhesive substance called Chatterton's
Compound, a mixture of resin, gutta-percha,
and Stockholm tar. This compound not only
renders the strand solid, and impervious to water,
but also acts as an adhesive connection between
the copper conductor itself and the insulator
with which it is to be coated. Bound together
with this or similar pitchy compounds, the
conductor and the insulator form a solid <i>core</i>
expanding and contracting together.</p>

<p>The insulator is always either of gutta-percha
or india-rubber, but most frequently the former;
and it is of course essential that there shall be no
flaw or defect, such as an air-bubble or steam-vesicle,
or hair or thread inclosed so as to deteriorate
its insulating properties. To guard against such
accidents, it is usual to apply a series of coatings
to make up the total thickness of the insulator.
Accordingly, when one coating has cooled, a layer
of Chatterton's Compound is applied to it, and
another coating overlaid, and so on, until the
required amount of insulating material has been
put on.</p>

<p>Whether the insulating substance is gutta-percha
or india-rubber, there is generally wound round it
a serving of untarred hemp or jute yarn, which has
either been tanned or soaked in brine as a preservative.
This is to act as a padding or cushion for
the iron sheathing or protector next to be applied.
This serving is applied in the following way. A
circular disc or frame, carrying on one face a series
of bobbins which hold the threads of the yarn, is
kept revolving. The core is made to pass through
a hole in the centre of this disc, and the threads
are wound spirally round it as the disc revolves.</p>

<p>The iron wires of the sheathing, which completely
inclose and cover the served core, are
wound on by the powerful 'cable machines,'
whose operation is so interesting a feature in
a visit to a cable factory. The great revolving
disc, seven or eight feet in diameter, is set round
with iron bobbins filled with the iron sheathing
wires. These bobbins are <i>suspended</i> on the face
of the disc, so that as the disc revolves they
always preserve their fixed position with respect
to the earth. In this way the wires themselves
are not twisted round their own axes as they
are laid on the core. These wires are generally
of the best homogeneous iron wire, that is, a
wire intermediate in quality between iron and
steel, and uniting some of the toughness of the
former to the strength of the latter. They are
sometimes themselves covered with a serving of
the best tarred Manilla hemp; sometimes laid on
in single wires abutting against each other, so as to
form a smooth and complete casing for the cable;
and sometimes they are applied in strands of three
wires, each abutting against each other. The
composite sheathing of hemp and iron is usually
applied to the deep-sea portion of a cable where,
in laying, a union of lightness and strength is
demanded, and where, when once laid, the cable is
not likely to be molested. The single-wire sheathing
is applied to cables to be laid in shallower
depths, such as coast-waters; and the heavy-strand
sheathing is for protecting the cable in anchorages
and on sea-beaches. The light-sheathed cable is
called 'main' or 'deep-sea cable;' the medium is
called 'intermediate;' and the heavy-sheathed cable
is called 'shore-end.' There is seldom more of the
last than ten or twelve miles, to carry the cable
well out of reach of the abrasion of storm-shifted
boulders and coast anchorage. The intermediate
usually extends until deep water has been reached,
where the deep-sea portion takes its place. These
three types of cable are connected together by
'taper pieces.' The core is of course uniform
throughout the entire length of the cable; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
taper pieces serve to connect the different types of
sheathing artistically and soundly with each other.
The intermediate cable generally has its sheathing
wires covered with a serving of mineral pitch,
silica, and hemp of a coarse quality, in order to
ward off as long as possible the dissolving action
of the sea-water.</p>

<p>The cable being thus finished at the manufactory,
it is coiled into large iron tanks, and there
immersed in brine until it is shipped for transport
and laying.</p>

<p>All the materials of a submarine cable are
carefully watched and tested&mdash;the iron wire, for
stretching, twisting, and breaking stress, and the
core for all its electric properties. The special
properties of every knot or mile of the core are
chronicled, so that a complete account of every
part of the cable is preserved during its progress
of manufacture. And after it is made, it is
tested electrically every day, to see that no
change takes place in its electric qualities.
These electric tests are three in number: For
<i>resistance</i>&mdash;the resistance of the copper wire to the
passage of the current. For <i>inductive capacity</i>&mdash;the
amount of charge or quantity of electricity
which the cable will take up. For <i>insulation
resistance</i>&mdash;the insulating power of the gutta-percha
coating.</p>

<p>These tests are made by direct comparison with
units, just as bodies are weighed by comparison
with a pound or unit of weight. The unit of
electric resistance is the <i>ohm</i>; so called after the
celebrated German physicist and electrician Ohm.
The ohm is the resistance of a certain length of
platinum-silver wire determined by a Committee
of the British Association. Multiples of the ohm
are readily obtained, and these are arranged and
made up into what are called <i>resistance-boxes</i>&mdash;the
practical tool of the electrician. A resistance-box
usually contains coils of platinum-silver wire of
from five thousand ohms downwards to single ohms
or fractions of an ohm. It is with this finely
graduated tool that the electrician compares the
resistance, or in other words ascertains the conducting
power of the cable.</p>

<p>The unit of measurement of the <i>insulation resistance</i>
of the cable is a very high multiple of the
ohm, called the <i>meg-ohm</i> or million-ohms; for
inasmuch as the insulator is, technically speaking,
a non-conductor, its office is to exercise the
necessary resistance to the escape of the current.
The unit for capacity is called a <i>micro-farad</i>
or millionth part of the <i>Farad</i>, which derives
its name from Faraday, and represents a certain
<i>quantity</i> of electricity. The practical tool for
the micro-farad is a contrivance called a <i>condenser</i>,
a description of which, without the aid
of drawings, would be too technical for our
readers. A submarine cable is itself, however,
a particular form of such a condenser. The
copper wire is one of the opposed conductors,
the sheathing, earth, and sea-water form the
other, and these are separated from each other
by the insulating coating of gutta-percha. It is a
curious fact that when a charge of electricity is
communicated to the copper wire of a cable,
it <i>induces</i> a charge of an opposite kind in the
earth outside. This inductive property of an
insulated wire contiguous to the earth has an
important bearing on practical telegraphy; for
inasmuch as the communicated charge and the
induced charge attract each other, the former
travels less swiftly along the wire; it is held back,
as it were, by the retarding influence of the earth's
induced charge; or in other words has a tendency
to ooze out of the cable instead of travelling
uninterruptedly to the other end. It is of consequence,
therefore, to ascertain the inductive
capacity of a cable; as the less it is, the greater
will the <i>speed</i> of signalling be.</p>

<p>The resistances and capacity of a cable are
usually tested, according to the standards of resistance
and capacity&mdash;that is, with the ohm, meg-ohm,
and micro-farad&mdash;by measuring the strength of an
electric current passing through the cable, by
means of an instrument called the galvanometer,
or current measurer. Its principle depends upon
the fact, discovered by Oersted, the famous Copenhagen
philosopher, that when a current is sent
along a wire in the neighbourhood of a freely
suspended magnetic needle, the needle will be
deflected into a new position, and this position
will be to right or to left according as the current
of one kind or the other is sent through the
wire. Moreover, the amount of deflection will
be directly proportional to the <i>strength</i> of the
current. This great discovery, which gave an
incalculably great impetus to the progress of the
telegraph, is the theoretical basis of the galvanometer.
One form of this instrument, used to test
submarine cables, is called the 'reflecting galvanometer,'
and is the invention of Sir William Thomson.
The wire through which the current to be
measured is made to pass, consists of a great many
turns of silk-covered or insulated copper of a very
fine gauge, forming a hollow coil, in the heart of
which a very diminutive magnetic needle is suspended
by a gossamer-like filament of floss silk.
This magnet (or magnets, for there are generally
more than one) carries a tiny circular mirror, the
whole arrangement of magnets and mirror being
no longer than (=) [Transcriber's note: The parallel
lines in the original shown here by = were 2mm (1/16") apart and 3mm (1/8") long.].
A beam of light is thrown
from a lamp in front on to the mirror, and reflected
back again on to a graduated pasteboard scale.
When the current to be measured is sent throughout
the coiled wire surrounding the magnets, they
are turned horizontally on their former position,
and the mirror is inclined round with them, so
that the reflected beam of light is moved along
the scale, the distance to which it is moved being
a measure of the current strength.</p>

<p>Now when the current from a given battery or
source of electricity is made to pass through wires
of different resistances, the strength of the current
which will pass through these wires can be made
a measure of their resistances; and therefore, when
the current from a particular battery is sent
through the conductor of the cable or to test
the insulator, and in each case measured by the
galvanometer, and compared with the current
from the same source which will flow through the
units of comparison, the copper resistance and
insulation resistance can be obtained.</p>

<p>In a somewhat similar way the capacity&mdash;the
<i>amount</i> of electricity which a cable will take&mdash;is
compared with the capacity of a standard condenser
or measure of capacity. The opposite plates
or sheets of the condenser are charged by a particular
battery; and as these charges are eager to
flow into each other and unite, but are held apart by
the insulator, they may be allowed to do so through
a wire or other conductor. The discharge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
opposite electricities into one another sets up a
short powerful current in this wire, and its strength
is proportional to the quantity of electricity discharged;
that is, to the capacity of the condenser.
If the coil of the galvanometer be substituted for
this discharging wire, the strength of this discharge
will be measured by the deflection of the gleam of
light on the scale. By charging alternately, therefore,
the condenser and the cable from the same
battery, and observing their respective discharges
by means of the galvanometer, the capacities of
the cable and condenser are compared.</p>

<p>The speed of signalling through a submarine
cable, that is to say the number of words per
minute that can be transmitted through it, varies
with the resistance of its conductor, its inductive
capacity, and its length; and it is by a consideration
of these properties, together with weight and
cost of material, that its form and dimensions are
designed; and on this interesting subject we may
have a few words to say in a future paper.</p></div>

<h2><a name="LIFE_IN_ST_KILDA" id="LIFE_IN_ST_KILDA">LIFE IN ST KILDA.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>FIRST PAPER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the following interesting account of the island
of St Kilda, we are indebted to Mr J. Sands, a
gentleman who has more than once visited the
rock, and who upon one occasion was detained
there for several months by stress of weather. As
will be seen by his narrative&mdash;the first portion of
which we now offer to our readers&mdash;he utilised his
opportunities for observing not only the manners
and customs of the natives, but many curious facts
connected with the natural history and even the
archæology of the islet. With these few words of
preface, we leave Mr Sands to tell his story.</p>

<p>Far out in the Atlantic&mdash;forty-nine miles west
from Obe in the Sound of Harris, and forty-three
from Shillay in the Outer Hebrides&mdash;there
is a group of islands, evidently of volcanic
origin, the largest of which, called <i>Hirta</i>
by the inhabitants, and St Kilda by strangers,
contains a small community who speak Gaelic
only, and have all Highland names. This island,
which is about three miles long by two broad,
is bounded on the north-east and south-west by
enormous precipices that rise like walls out of the
sea. These cliffs are frequented by vast numbers
of sea-fowl; by puffins, cormorants, guillemots,
auks, and other birds. A species of gull called
the fulmar also abounds, and is of great value
to the inhabitants, who salt the flesh for food
in winter and sell the oil and feathers. St Kilda
is the only island in Great Britain where that
bird breeds. About three miles to the north-east
of St Kilda is an island called Boreray, which
is the great resort of solan-geese, which also
frequent the <i>stacks</i> or isolated rocks adjacent.</p>

<p>The population of St Kilda numbers at present
seventy-five souls. It was considerably larger
some two centuries ago. Where the community
originally came from no one knows. Their early
history is lost in darkness; but it can be traced
back to the fourteenth century. In 1697 Martin
visited the island, and wrote a quaint but faithful
account of it. At present there is no regular communication
between St Kilda and any other place
except by a boat called 'the smack,' which is sent
out by the proprietor (MacLeod of MacLeod) twice
a year&mdash;namely in summer and autumn, to collect
the rents, to carry away the produce, and to
furnish supplies. Some bold yachtsman generally
pays the island a hurried visit about the end of
summer; but as the anchorage is dangerous, he
seldom or never remains more than two or three
hours. Some of the natives have been as far as
Lewis, Harris, and Uist, and surprise the others
with tales of the wonders they have seen in those
distant places; a man with a wooden leg having
apparently created the greatest interest. But the
majority have never been farther than Boreray.
No people can be more isolated or less indebted
to their neighbours for example or instruction in
the ways of civilised life. Notwithstanding this,
it will be difficult to find a better-behaved community&mdash;one
more pious, sober, industrious, polite,
and hospitable.</p>

<p>I had always a great desire to see this <i>Ultima
Thule</i>, and in 1875 the proprietor's factor agreed to
give me a passage in his smack to the island. On
the 3d of June I landed, and at my own desire
was left behind when the smack sailed from the
bay on the 6th. I remained on St Kilda about
seven weeks, and passed the time in rambling
about the island, trying to learn Gaelic, making
excursions to the other islands in the boats along
with the natives, and in visiting them in their
homes. I lived in a house by myself and cooked
my own food. I had a set of bagpipes with me
and a flute, and when threatened with melancholy
cheered myself with a tune on these instruments.
I bought some biscuits, oatmeal, &amp;c., and
a sheep or two, and the women kept me supplied
gratis with turf for my fire. At the end of seven
weeks the yacht <i>Crusader</i> came into the bay, the
owner of which kindly gave me a passage to
Greenock. Before I left St Kilda I had an
opportunity of seeing how the trade was conducted&mdash;the
low prices which the poor people
received for their produce, and the high prices
they were obliged to pay for their supplies, and I
felt no little sympathy for them. Animated with
a desire to better their condition and assimilate
themselves with their more fortunate brethren
of the mainland, they requested me several times
to try to get them a boat large enough to carry
a crew and cargo to Harris, where they might
carry on their trade on more profitable terms than
with the proprietor. On my return home I got
a boat built for them, and started a subscription
to pay for her. I further resolved to go out
in her myself, so as to see her safely delivered to
the people, and to give them a little enlightenment
as to the prices of commodities in the outer world.</p>

<p>On the 30th May 1876 I arrived at Lochgilphead
to get possession of the boat, which seemed suitable
for the purpose; and by the kind assistance of
Messrs Hutcheson, the well-known ship-owners, I
reached Stornoway, <i>en route</i> for St Kilda, in safety.</p>

<p>I remained in Stornoway weather-bound until
the 12th June, and whilst waiting for a fair wind
to continue our voyage westward, let me narrate a
mysterious occurrence, bearing on my narrative,
that took place some years ago.</p>

<p>In the month of April 1864 a boat left St
Kilda for Stornoway with a woman and seven
men on board. Every man had a chest, and the
woman a small box; and they took provisions with
them, and some salt-fish and home-spun cloth to
pay expenses. The islanders went up the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
called Oswald or <i>Osimhal</i> and watched the boat
for several hours. All seemed well. The woman
in the boat intended to visit some relations at
Loch Inver.</p>

<p>On a Sunday about a month afterwards, three
London smacks entered the bay and brought the
news that the boat was lost near Lewis with
all on board. Never doubting the truth of the
intelligence, the inhabitants gave vent to their
grief without restraint. The three skippers came
on shore and beguiled the time by playing quoits
with flat stones, and when they witnessed the
agitation of the bereaved St Kildans, they jeered in
mockery. There was no minister on the island at
the time, but a probationer called Kennedy filled
the office. Although he understood English as well
as Gaelic, he never thought of taking a note of
the names of the smacks. The St Kildans say the
crews belonged to London, but that <i>one man could
speak Gaelic</i>. Some time afterwards some of the
clothes of the missing men, torn as if in a scuffle,
were brought to St Kilda by the then factor, and
were said to have been found in a cave at Lewis.
The people got gradually resigned to their fate,
although I heard them on my first visit declare that
they believed the lost crew had been murdered.
But I thought at the time that this was a preposterous
suspicion, which could only be entertained
by people living in solitude and ignorant of the
world outside. But strange to relate I was told
by Mr MacIver, banker in Stornoway, that a letter
had been received from a firm in the Transvaal
Republic, by the minister of Harris, stating that
Donald MacKinnon, one of the lost crew, had
just died at Pilgrim's Rest, Lydenburg Gold-fields,
of a fever, and had left property to the amount
of thirty-seven pounds. On my expressing a
suspicion that the strange story might be untrue,
Mr MacIver informed me that the money had
actually been lodged with him.</p>

<p>Why Donald MacKinnon had never written to
St Kilda to inform his father and other relatives of
his fate, is a mystery that none can fathom. But
if he was preserved, it is possible that some others
of the missing crew may have been saved too.
I may mention that Sir John MacLeod, then
proprietor of St Kilda, caused an inquiry to be
made at Lewis at the time the boat was lost; but
without eliciting any information.</p>

<p>At Stornoway, I was introduced to Captain
Macdonald of the fishery cruiser <i>Vigilant</i>, and
hospitably entertained in that smart vessel. He
seemed desirous to give me a convoy to St Kilda;
but the Board, to whom I applied, declined to
allow him to leave his station. On the 12th June,
however, he took me on board and my boat in
tow, and conveyed us to the island of Scalpa,
where I abode for several days in the house of Mr
Campbell, the chief man of the island, who treated
me with true Highland hospitality. Mr Campbell's
house stands on the site of one recently demolished,
in which Prince Charlie found shelter when hiding
from his enemies. A stone above the door bearing
an inscription in Gaelic, records the fact. In one
of the cottages in Scalpa I saw about a dozen
girls thickening blankets; this they did by tossing
them about upon a broad board. One of the girls
sung a Gaelic song, whilst the others joined in the
chorus. On my entering the room the songstress
cleverly composed a verse about me. I was much
interested with this ancient Highland custom.</p>

<p>The land in Scalpa is poor and boggy; but some
of the people are fine specimens of humanity&mdash;good-looking
and polite. Some of them expressed
an opinion that the island was over-populated,
which I am afraid is the case, although I should be
sorry to see such men leave the country. On the
17th, the <i>Vigilant</i>, which had returned to Stornoway,
again called at Scalpa, and took me and my
boat on to Obe in the Sound of Harris. The navigation
of these straits is considered very difficult;
but Captain Macdonald, as if to display his seamanship,
ran down the Sound and then tacked up
again without fear, and in a manner that excited
my admiration. I had never seen a smarter vessel
or seaman.</p>

<p>At Obe I found the factor's smack lying weather-bound.
Here also I saw two St Kildan women
who had come to Harris nine months previously,
and were yearning to be home again, never having
heard from their husbands since they left. On the
18th the <i>Vigilant</i> returned to Stornoway.</p>

<p>At Obe I engaged two men to work the boat to
St Kilda, agreeing to pay them eight pounds for
the trip, but stipulating that when the boat reached
the bay they were to have no further claim upon
me. This seems a large sum; but for all I knew
they might have had to live for weeks in the
island without a chance of returning. However,
they arranged with the smack's skipper (an old
friend) for a return passage; and on the 21st, at
seven in the morning, we set sail&mdash;two men and
myself in the new boat, a rope connecting us with
the smack. When about half-way St Kilda was
descried on the western horizon&mdash;'suspected more
than seen,' for though the day was bright and
sunny a thick haze obscured the distance. We
reached the island about five in the evening,
and separating from the smack, cast our anchor
near the shore. Soon a crowd began to gather
on the rocks, but they did not seem in a hurry to
launch their boat. I observed one of the women
who had come with the smack standing on deck
and holding up her infant (born during her absence
from St Kilda) in a triumphant manner, although
she was too distant to be seen from the shore. At
length a boat is pushed off and pulls towards us;
the crew stare doubtfully at me, and then, as they
come alongside, repeat my name and grasp my
hand. I and the two men who had come with
me jump into the shore-boat, and are landed on the
rocky bank amidst a crowd of men and women.
But whilst I am busy shaking hands with this old
friend and that, one of the Harris men suddenly
discloses the story about the lost boat and Donald
MacKinnon, and in a moment all is confusion,
grief, and amazement. Women squat upon the
ground and chant their lamentations; and men
stand with open mouths and eyes and mutter
observations in Gaelic on the wonderful news.</p>

<p>The boat goes off to the smack and brings the
two women on shore, where they are received with
conjugal kisses. Ten months had elapsed from
the receipt in Harris of the letter from Africa until
its arrival in St Kilda&mdash;although the one place is
visible from the other in a clear day.</p>

<p>I must now try to describe the village. It
is built on a comparatively level piece of ground
about twenty feet above the sea, at the foot of
steep hills, has a southerly exposure, and consists of
nineteen cottages, arranged like a crescent. They
are plainly built and roofed with zinc. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
erected about fourteen years ago. But the old
huts in which the people formerly dwelt still
stand, and are picturesque structures. The walls
of these are double, with turf packed in between.
They are built without lime, and are thatched
with straw, held down by ropes of the same
material attached to stones. They are said to
have been very warm and comfortable. In some
of them are beds in the wall, accessible by a
hole like the mouth of a baker's oven. These
huts are now used as cow-houses, barns, and
cellars, and are similar to the houses in Lewis,
Harris, and other islands of the Hebrides. I
include the manse or parsonage in the above
number, although it is rather better built. At
the back of it stands the church, a modern
and ugly building. The plan of the village was
until lately like the framework of a boy's kite;
but the staff is now gone, and the bow alone
remains. In front of the village and between it
and the sea, is a patch of arable ground of about
fifteen or twenty acres in extent, divided into lots.
There are also patches of arable ground behind
the village. The whole is inclosed by a massive
dry stone wall, to keep off cattle. But what chiefly
excites the attention and wonder of the stranger
is the immense number of small houses everywhere
to be seen around the village and clustered
all over the island, up even to the summit of the
hills. These are called <i>clætan</i>, and are used
as storehouses for turf and grass. They are called
pyramids by Martin. In general they are built so
narrow that single stones can be laid from one
wall to the other to form the roof. Some of these
primitive structures are said to be ancient; but I
have seen others erected on exactly the same
system, for architecture has not changed in St Kilda,
as in other places. Behind the village the steep
hills rise to a considerable height, Connagher being
one thousand three hundred feet above the sea.
The bay or loch is open on the south-east. It is
sheltered on the south-west by a long craggy
island called the Dun.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the factor's smack left for Dunvegan.
Before going on board he presented a
document to the men, who were all assembled on
the shore, and requested them to sign it. He
made no objection to their trying to go to Harris
in the new boat; but he wanted to know if they
wished the proprietor to send supplies as usual.
The men seemed resolved to make use of the new
boat; but were persuaded by the minister to sign
the paper. I was not pleased at this transaction,
for although the boat was found very useful in
making trips to the other islands for birds, she
was procured for the express purpose of enabling
the people to trade with Harris. When they had
signed the paper, which bound them still to continue
their transactions with the factor, my object
was in a measure frustrated, and the islanders had
no alternative but that of still relying upon the
smack for their autumn supply of oatmeal and
other articles from the mainland.</p>

<p>For a few days I took lodgings in one of the
cottages; but afterwards I got a house to myself,
and cooked my own food.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June I went with a party of
eighteen men and boys in the new boat to the
island of Boreray. All the men but two, who
were left to take charge of the boat, ascended the
cliffs, and I was tempted to go along with them.
With the end of a rope round my waist, held by
a man who preceded me, I clambered up such
paths as one may see in a nightmare. I thought
it best not to look too far ahead, but to keep my
attention fixed on the ground at my feet. Sometimes
I was indebted to my guide for a pull up
some difficult bit; and I succeeded in reaching the
top. The height was probably eight hundred feet&mdash;the
highest rocks on this island being over a
thousand. Some of the cliffs were white with
solan-geese. All the men dispersed and descended
the cliffs to catch fulmars, and I was left in charge
of a youth called <i>Callum Beag</i>, or Little Malcolm,
who will retain the same name although he grows
to six feet.</p>

<p>It is the custom of the St Kildans to send
a party of young women to this island every
year to catch puffins for the sake of the feathers.
During my first visit I had gone with such a party
to Boreray, and saw them at work. Rearing their
young in holes in the turf, these curious birds
(called <i>Tammie Nories</i> in some places) require
dodging to get at, and great care in handling,
as their bite is very severe. Being acquainted
with their habits, the women take dogs with
them, which are taught to alarm the puffins
and to catch them as they flutter out of their
holes. The girls also place hair-ropes on the
ground, held down at the ends by stones. Nooses
of horse-hair are affixed to the rope, into which
the birds (which frequent this island in incredible
numbers) push their feet. In this way some
of the girls catch as many as four or five hundred
puffins in a day. The young women remain about
three weeks on the island, all alone by themselves.
They work until they drop asleep. Every one
takes her Gaelic Bible with her, for all can read
with ease. They sleep in the clothes they wear
during the day. On my second visit to this island,
I took a glance at the houses in which these bird-catchers
reside. They are three in number, and
are covered outside with earth and turf, and look
like grassy hillocks. One of them is fifteen feet
long by six feet wide. It is six and a half feet
high at the hearth, which is close to the door.
A semicircular stone seat runs round the hearth.
The rest of the floor is raised a foot higher,
and is used as a bed. The door is about two
and a half feet high, and has to be entered on
hands and knees. These houses are built on the
same plan as the <i>clætan</i>, but are covered outside
with earth and turf for the sake of warmth.</p>

<p>A house of the bee-hive type, described by Martin
and Macaulay, formerly stood on this island; but to
my great regret it has been demolished within the
memory of man. It was inhabited by a hermit
called Stallir. The people have several traditionary
tales about this house. When I had seen all
that was to be seen, I grew tired sitting on the
top of the cliff, and ventured to descend without
assistance. Callum Beag tried to remonstrate, but
I persisted, and fortunately succeeded in reaching
the boat below. I had begun to be familiar with
great heights, for it is all a matter of custom.
In a short time all the men were seen descending
the cliffs laden with fulmars; and hoisting our lug-sail
and jib we returned to St Kilda.</p>

<p>One day shortly after my arrival an old man
happening to be up the hill at the back of the
village descried what he imagined to be two
marks cut on the turf on the top of Boreray. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
party of men, it is necessary to explain, had
gone to that island about a fortnight before
to <i>pluck</i> the sheep which are kept there, for
shears are as yet unknown in St Kilda. He came
down in great distress, and communicated the
intelligence to the rest of the people, who, to my
surprise, were thrown into a state of consternation.
The women seated themselves on the ground and
chanted lamentations. On inquiring the reason, I
was informed that a system of telegraphy had been
long established in St Kilda, and that two marks
cut in the turf in Boreray signified that one or
more of the party were sick or dead, and that a
boat was wanted immediately. I went up the
hill, and with a glass discovered that one of the
marks was a number of men building a <i>clæt</i>. I
explained this to some of the people who had
followed me, but failed to convince them for a
time. In the evening, however, when the boat
returned from Boreray with the plucking-party all
well, the sceptics acknowledged with joyful smiles
that my glass was better than their eyes.</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_LUDICROUS" id="THE_LUDICROUS">THE LUDICROUS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would appear that the human memory is more
retentive of the grotesque and ludicrous, whether
moral or physical, than of the sublime and beautiful
in nature, the graver incidents of life or the
loftier mental experiences. We recall with realistic
distinctness every object whose saliency has consisted
in pleasing distortion, and every event that
has in any way appealed to our sense of humour;
while we may reproduce but faintly the impressions
received from the contemplation of the
highest works of art, the most perfect landscape,
or the ordinary vicissitudes of the world. In
every-day language, this is largely accounted for
by the force with which the exception to any
given rule, the aberration from ordinary courses
of action, and the departure from universally
accepted principles, arrest our attention in virtue
of their rarity. This of course applies to many
other classes of phenomena besides the odd, the
distorted, the whimsical, or the ridiculous; but
the human mind, strange though it seems, has
undoubtedly a greater facility for the reception
and reproduction of these than of any other.</p>

<p>If we deliberately cast back in our minds for
the images of our early playmates and school-fellows,
we observe that the first to present themselves,
as a rule, are those possessing some marked
peculiarities, and that those peculiarities are the
centre-points of the pictures. Ordinary faces and
physiques, even of those near and dear to us,
shew but dimly on memory's canvas; but a
squint, a lisp, a burr, freckles, ungainliness, or
oddity of manner, has stamped there the images
of comparative strangers with indelible clearness;
and the blemishes which produce these results
are themselves not only plainly delineated, but
frequently exaggerated. Again, if we permit the
mind to revert unrestrainedly to the <i>events</i> of childhood,
the earliest to suggest themselves are, almost
invariably, those which have exercised our risible
faculties or sense of the absurd&mdash;the laughable
scrapes, odd predicaments, amusing exploits of ourselves
or others, are the things remembered of our
youth. The recollections of any two men of middle
age with regard to their common school-days teem
with whimsical anecdotes, to the almost total
extinguishing of other things. This experience
may be termed universal, and suggests the curious
question: To what extent should we be at all able,
if devoid of the sense of humour, to recall the
companions and incidents of our childhood and
youth?</p>

<p>Let us look at our subject from another point of
view. What do we find on attempting to recall
our knowledge of 'the men of all times,' whose
biographies we have read? We cast our net, as it
were, into the pool of our recollections&mdash;say, for
example, regarding a Napoleon, a Newton, or a
Columbus. The result is significant. Beyond an
imperfect conception of the scope and lesson of
their lives, nine out of ten fairly intelligent people
will succeed in landing only a few trifles in the
shape of anecdotes, physical peculiarities, or amusing
idiosyncrasies. The first was the ambitious
disturber of Europe; the second, a philosopher;
the last, discovered America. In addition&mdash;what?
Why, Napoleon was fond of snuff, which he
carried loose in his waistcoat pocket, and was
called 'the Little Corporal.' The expounder of the
law of gravitation on one occasion used his sweetheart's
finger as a tobacco-stopper. And the private
life of Columbus is epitomised in the apocryphal
story of making an egg stand on end. Popularly,
the portraits of heroes and notabilities
are distinct in proportion to the number and saliency
of their blemishes. (Who can forget the wen
on Cromwell's nose?) On the other hand, their
hopes, their loves, their sorrows, their great life-purposes,
their very identities, are held together
in the minds of the masses by the force of association
with trivial and adventitious circumstances.
It is an odd but not necessarily a humiliating
reflection; for the mind that can find 'good in all
things' will see in it a most wise and important
provision in our mental economy.</p>

<p>The simplest and best known rule in the so-called
art of Mnemonics is, naturally enough, based
upon a recognition of the facility with which anything
connected with the grotesque, absurd, or
whimsical may be recalled. Dates, statistics,
names, &amp;c. are taken into the memory along with
some catch-word or ludicrous expression, and are
by that means reproducible almost at will. We are
not prepared to say in how far such a rule is in
the long-run beneficial or injurious to the natural
memory, nor to decide to what extent thus deliberately
burdening the mind with a host of distorted
conceptions goes to counterbalance the immediate
advantages sought. It is sufficient for our present
purpose that its application is illustrative of what
we have said.</p>

<p>The deliberate action of the mind, dictated by
this rule, in seeking the aid of whimsicalities as
the milestones and finger-posts of memory, is not
only sanctioned (as we have said) by the recognition
of one of its inherent properties, but by the most
unmistakable precedents in its own natural operation.
Surnames which do not owe their origin
to the professions of those who first assumed
them, or to modifications of Christian names,
partake largely of the humorous in their conception,
as we have shewn in former articles on
Names in this <i>Journal</i>. They are, in fact, epigrammatic.
Doubtless, among races in which the
susceptibility to humour is very subordinate to
other sensibilities, these epigram-names will embody
less of that element; but even amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
gravest tribes of North American Indians, and the
melancholy races of Eastern Asia, secondary titles
are in common use for ordinary and familiar
occasions, answering exactly to our own idea of
nicknames. Amongst ourselves the coinage of
surnames has long ago been completed and in full
circulation, their original meanings having now no
force or application to the persons bearing them.
Even nicknames have almost disappeared from
polite literature and society with the increasing
sensitiveness of the age. The art of 'smashing' in
the matter of names, however, still lingers in the
nursery and the playground, as well as in the
inner circles of family life generally; and if we
cast an observing glance down the social scale, we
shall find the practice more and more widely
obtaining, until, amongst the rural population
and the operatives of Lancashire and the Black
Country, we find it absolutely universal. In the
latter locality, indeed, the inapplicability of
authorised surnames has led to their total disuse.
We read some years ago a Report from an official
source, in which it was circumstantially stated that
many of the puddlers, nailers, and others had
utterly forgotten their original or baptismal name,
being invariably addressed and known by a <i>sobriquet</i>,
which hit off some whimsical peculiarity of
person or character. We ourselves have a lively
recollection of a woman in the neighbourhood of
Bilston to whom her own husband's real name was
so unfamiliar that she entirely failed to recognise
it when we questioned her regarding him.</p>

<p>Scottish literature, and that of England which in
point of national progress corresponds to it, owe
much of their vigour and enjoyableness to the
quaintness of the counterfeit nomenclature with
which they abound; and at the same time indicate
the prevalence of epigrammatic humorous names
in the age which produced them. One of our
finest ballads indeed&mdash;The Blithesome Bridal&mdash;is
little other than a catalogue of trenchant nicknames:
'Will wi' the meikle mou,' 'Bow-legged
Robbie,' 'Thumbless Katie,' 'Plouckie-faced Wat
i' the mill;' and so on.</p>

<p>If then the human mind has not only an
exceptional facility for the reproduction of whimsicalities,
but a significant tendency to seek for
and employ these as aids to the memory of more
serious but less salient things, how shall we
estimate <i>the mnemonic value of the sense of the
ludicrous</i>? We have no desire, even if space would
permit, to treat the inquiry exhaustively; but
may point out one or two of the leading facts on
which so curious an investigation might be based,
and one or two reflections which the subject immediately
suggests.</p>

<p>First, then, it is a well-established truth that
the barbarous races which have proved totally
unsusceptible of civilisation are those which are
utterly or almost utterly devoid of the sense of
humour: exemplified in the aborigines of Australia
and the Indians of the West; while on the other
hand the Negro, endowed with the most whimsical
of fancies, has, though steeped in barbarism, the
latent germ of intellectual and moral progress.
Secondly, among the so-called civilised branches
of the human family, the Caucasian, with its rich
vein of humour, its hearty power of laughter, and
its deftness in extracting from every condition of
things the elixir of fun, stands in unapproachable
superiority. Lastly, to those whose observation of
national character has been sufficiently minute and
varied, it will be equally clear that those European
peoples which have the finest and deepest appreciation
of the quaint and ludicrous (entirely distinct
from wit), have also the greatest staying power
intellectually and morally, and the largest possibility
of development.</p>

<p>It would seem a fair inference from these facts
alone, had we not already indicated it, that it is
man's moral nature which benefits most largely by
the presence in the mental economy of a sense of
the ludicrous. The saying, 'Beware of him who
cannot laugh,' is a pithy but conclusive commentary.
All that is fairest in human life; all that is best and
brightest in our earthly lot; the tender memories
of childhood; the generous ties of friendship; the
various sympathies which constitute the history of
our inner selves, are rendered vivid and operative
for our highest culture by the action of the simple
yet unique mnemonic law which we have thus
imperfectly examined.</p></div>
